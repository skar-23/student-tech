   - Verify internet connection

2. **"Components not found"**
   - Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies
   - Check file paths and imports
   - Verify Radix UI components are installed

3. **"Progress not saving"**
   - Check browser localStorage permissions
   - Clear localStorage and try again
   - Verify data persistence logic

### **Debug Commands**
```bash
# Check if AI server is running
npm run genkit:dev

# Test component imports
npm run dev

# Verify TypeScript compilation
npx tsc --noEmit
```
